# Troubleshooting

## Missing Libraries or Modules

If you encounter issues where certain libraries are not bundled with the executable (e.g., missing dependencies), you can try the following:
`pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --hidden-import=module_name main.py`

## Large Executable Size

If the generated executable is large, itâ€™s because PyInstaller bundles all required libraries into the .exe or .app file. You can use compression tools or remove unnecessary files if needed.
